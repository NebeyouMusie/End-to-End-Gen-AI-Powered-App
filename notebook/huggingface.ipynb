For example, between 2021 and 2022, the labor market continued to improve, which may have affected private coverage in the United States \\nduring that time.\\n1 Public policy changes included \\nthe renewal of the Public Health Emergency, which \\nallowed Medicaid enrollees to remain covered under the Continuous Enrollment Provision.\\n2 The American \\nRescue Plan (ARP) enhanced Marketplace premium subsidies for those with incomes above 400 percent of the poverty level as well as for unemployed people.\\n3\\nIn addition to national policies, individual states and the District of Columbia can affect health insurance coverage by making Marketplace or Medicaid more accessible and affordable. This variation may be more or less pronounced across states. Missouri and \\nOklahoma expanded Medicaid eligibility under the \\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2022, leaving only twelve states without expanded Medicaid eligibility, primarily in the South and parts \\n1 The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported increases in national \\nemployment from 2021 to 2022.

As a result, a variety of changes in coverage rates are possible. \\nThis brief uses the 2021 and 2022 American \\nCommunity Survey (ACS) 1-year estimates to exam-ine differences in health insurance coverage status and select subtypes (Medicaid, direct purchase, and employer-based) for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 25 most populous metro-politan areas (refer to the “What Is Health Insurance Coverage?” text box).\\n7 It also examines year-to-year \\nchanges (2021 to 2022) across these geographies. \\n4 Note that for the purposes of this brief, we consider a state \\nto have expanded Medicaid eligibility if it expanded eligibility on \\nor before January 1st of that expansion year. For a state to have \\nexpanded Medicaid eligibility in 2022, it would have had to expand \\neligibility after January 1, 2021, but before January 1, 2022.

       "\"\\n\\nHealth insurance coverage is a contract between an individual or group and an insurance company that provides financial protection against the cost of medical care. The insurance company agrees to pay for certain medical expenses, while the insured pays a premium and may also be responsible for copayments, deductibles, and coinsurance.\\n\\nThere are different types of health insurance plans, including:\\n\\n1. Fee-for-service plans: These plans allow insured individuals to choose their own healthcare providers and pay for services on a per-visit basis.\\n2. Health maintenance organizations (HMOs): HMOs require insured individuals to choose a primary care physician who manages their care and refers them to specialists as needed.\\n3. Preferred provider organizations (PPOs): PPOs allow insured individuals to choose their healthcare providers from a network of preferred providers, and may offer more flexibility in terms of out-of-network care.\\n4. Point-of-service (POS) plans: POS plans are similar to PPOs, but require insured individuals to choose a primary care physician and obtain a referral to see specialists.\\n5. Exclusive provider organizations (EPOs): EPOs are similar to HMOs, but do not offer out-of-network coverage, meaning insured individuals must use in-network providers to receive coverage.\\n\\nIt's important to note that health insurance coverage can vary significantly depending on the specific plan and the insurer, so it's important to carefully review the details of any plan before enrolling. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires most Americans to have health insurance coverage or face a penalty, unless they qualify for an exemption.\""
